Qt Designer is the Qt tool for designing and building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with Qt Widgets. You can compose and customize your windows or dialogs in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) manner, and test them using different styles and resolutions.

Widgets and forms created with Qt Designer integrate seamlessly with programmed code, using Qt's signals and slots mechanism, so that you can easily assign behavior to graphical elements. All properties set in Qt Designer can be changed dynamically within the code. Furthermore, features like widget promotion and custom plugins allow you to use your own components with Qt Designer.

Note: You have the option of using Qt Quick for user interface design rather than widgets. It is a much easier way to write many kinds of applications. It enables a completely customizable appearance, touch-reactive elements, and smooth animated transitions, backed up by the power of OpenGL graphics acceleration.
